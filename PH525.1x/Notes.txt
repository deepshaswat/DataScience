average of vector: mean(<vector_name>)

car is a data set with 2 column: speed and dist
to find the average of the distace: mean(cars[,2])

Summation of a series using FOR loop
s <- 0
for(i in 1:25){
  s <- s + i*i
}
s  

which function

which(cars[,2] == 85) compares the value of distace column with 85 and prints the row no

File Name: script.Rmd
Used to write the simple text and the code. The output file can be a HTML File or a pdf file
With # sign the title is given and the code is written in the ``` section

output: pdf_document

#My Script

A liner model


```{r}
x<- 1:10
y <- rnorm(10)
plot(x,y)
fit <- lm(y~x)
```

code.R:
 Reading data from a csv file: read.csv("")

 Help can be accessed using the following command: ?read.csv

Homework:
 dat <- read.csv("femaleMiceWeights.csv")
dat
names(dat)
dat[12,2]

#this extracts the Bodyweight column and prints the value of the 11th row
dat$Bodyweight[11]		

v2 <- c(dat[13:24,])
mean(v2$Bodyweight)
or
mean(dat$Bodyweight[which(dat$Diet == "hf")])
# the above command selects the data for the col Diet with valu = hf and then calculates the mean for the row val in the col Bodyweight

Sampling:
Using the sample() function we can sample the data.
Using set.seed(1) prior to the sample command, we can get the same value after each command.

set.seed(1);sample(dat$Bodyweight[13:24],1)

# the above command sets the seed to 1 and then gets the sample data for the Bodyweight field of dat for the range of 13:24 rows and only 1 value to be printed.

Package: dplyr
View(dat)

filters: Used to filter the DF. It is used with select to select any particular column.
Also unlist function can be used to convert the data frame to a vector

%>% - this is used as a pipe to redirect the output as an input to another function.

E.g:
controls <- filter(dat, Diet=="chow")
controls <- select(controls, Bodyweight)
unlist(controls)
View(controls)

controls <- filter(dat, Diet =="chow") %>% select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist

Homework:

Reading a new csv file
dat1 <- read.csv("msleep_ggplot2.csv")
class(dat1)

View(dat1)

#Creating a filter and selecting the sleep time of a particular filter
controls <- filter(dat1, order == "Primates") %>% select(sleep_total)
nrow(controls)	#count the number of rows for the filter
class(controls)
mean(controls$sleep_total)		#calculating the mean after the filter and the select


controls <- filter(dat1, order == "Primates") %>% summarize(mean(sleep_total))
#calculating the mean after filter without select and using summarize which clubs the select with anyother function which returns a single value and in this case the mean of the select for the sleep_total
